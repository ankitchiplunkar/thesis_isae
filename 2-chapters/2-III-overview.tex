\section*{\hfil  Overview \hfil }

Computer codes are widely used in science and engineering to describe physical phenomena.
Advances in physics and computer science lead to increased complexity for the simulators.

During engineering design we often have access to varying types of simulation codes. There are high-fidelity codes which are costly and there are cheap codes which are low-fidelity\footnote{fidelity = accuracy}. For example, we can increase the mesh size in a CSM simulation thereby making it run faster but have lesser accuracy. This creates a huge cost saving opportunity, where we can call the cheap code multiple times for exploring the design space and run the costly code a few times for exploiting the design space.
