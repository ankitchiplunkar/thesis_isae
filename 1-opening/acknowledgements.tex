\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would, first of all, extend my gratitude to Dr. Nicolas Gayton and Dr. Alexander Forrester for accepting to review this thesis and Dr. Nathalie Bartoli and Dr. Rodolphe Le Riche for agreeing to be part of the jury. 

This research work being a CIFRE thesis gave me the opportunity to work, both in an academic environment (ISAE Toulouse) and in a company (Airbus Operations S.A.S.). On the academic side, I would like to thank my tutors Dr. Joseph Morlier and  Dr. Emmanuel Rachelson. They both patiently listened to my wacky ideas and nudged me into more productive directions. They have the capability to understand and explain concepts from their lowest principles, a quality which I admire and would like to replicate.  

At Airbus, I am really indebted to my industrial supervisor Michele Colombo, who took part in developing the wacky ideas and attempting to make them work, working with him has been the exact opposite of a stereotypical Ph.D experience (context: \url{http://phdcomics.com/}). I would also like to thank Sebastien Blanc for encouraging and helping me integrate into the French-speaking environment. He believed in my capabilities and let me apply algorithms in the intensive flight-test campaign. 

I thank the whole EGLRM team at Airbus, my colleagues during the plateau, members of the V\&V IPT, and researchers at the ICA lab. I have really enjoyed my conversations with Hitul Dhoru, Simon Trapier, Alex Calder, Elisa Bosco and Sebastian Delord. 

As always, I am forever grateful to my family for their love and understanding, my father for his inspiration, my mother for her unconditional love, my wife for being a great teacher and my brother for being my bro. 

While all the above people have shaped me in the last 3 years by their presence, I have learned a lot virtually from the blogs of Vitalik Buterin, tweets of Naval Ravikant and books of Yuval Noah Harari, I extend my thanks to them as well.
