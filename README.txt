ISAE-Supaero LaTeX template for project reports


INTRODUCTION
------------
This LaTeX report template has been designed in order to help students 
writing their projects/intership reports. A skeleton is already proposed
in French.

Notice that the report template breaks into several files in order to
enable collaborative work over a version control system such as Git or
Subversion (SVN).


REQUIREMENTS
------------
 A full LaTeX distribution such as TexLive (>2012) or MikTex (>2012).
 An UTF-8 aware text editor such as TexMaker or Emacs.
 Optionally: a bibliography manager such as JabRef can be used in order
to edit the .bib file.


USAGE
-----
 Edit the {.tex,.bib} files using UTF-8 encoding.
 Rename the .tex files according to your report structure. Update the
links accordingly in "isae-report-template.tex".
 Put your figures in the "images" subdirectory.

The compilation process is the following:
1) Compile the main file "isae-report-template.tex" using PDFLatex.
2) Compile the "isae-report-template.aux" using BibTeX.
3) Compile twice the main file "isae-report-template.tex" using PDFLatex.


FILES MANIFEST
--------------
 "isae-report-template.tex": main LaTeX file of the report.
 "isae-report-template.pdf": main output file of the report. 
 "0*.tex": LaTeX parts of the report (introduction, chapters...).
 "references.bib": bibliography database used by default.
 "authoryear-fr": a bibliography style file used by default.
 "images": subdirectory used to store the figures.
 "README.txt": the current file.
